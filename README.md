# Dual Universe Lua Library
This is a library of player created lau scripts for the game Dual Universe.
This library is maintained by the members and legates of the in-game organization [**Corellian Engineering Corp**](https://dualuniverselualibrary.page.link/cec).

Scripts themselves may be internally created by our members OR sources discovered externally outside our group. These scripts encompass any useful custom lua code as it pertains to static, dynamic and space cores.

If you would like to contribute to this library, please join our discord server: [https://discord.gg/Hu8GC5D](https://discord.gg/Hu8GC5D)
